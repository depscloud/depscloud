### feat(gh-15): support field indexes

This started as an idea, and a quick implementation came together rather quick.
After a quick refactor of the database support structures, adding support for this was much easier.
This indexes a handful of fields (namely, `url` on sources and `language` and `name` for modules).
This allows clients to quickly search for nodes in their graph.

**New Endpoints**

By adding support for field indexes, we were able to implement the following endpoints in REST and gRPC.

| Description                                       | Endpoints                                          |
|:--------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------|
| List languages deps.cloud has modules for.        | grpc - `depscloud.api.v1beta.LanguageService#List` |
|                                                   | rest -  `/v1beta/languages`                        |
|                                                   | cli  - `deps get languages`                        |
| <hr/> | <hr/> |
| Search modules containing the provided name part. | grpc - `depscloud.api.v1beta.ModuleService#Search` |
|                                                   | rest - `/v1beta/modules/search?like.name=xxx`      |
|                                                   | cli  - `deps search modules`                       |
| <hr/> | <hr/> |
| Search sources containing the provided url part.  | grpc - `depscloud.api.v1beta.SourceService#Search` |
|                                                   | rest - `/v1beta/sources/search?like.url=xxx`       |
|                                                   | cli  - `deps search sources`                       |
