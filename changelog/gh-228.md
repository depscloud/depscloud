### feat(gh-228): move off gogo protobuf

For better compatibility with the standard tooling provided by the community, we moved from the gogo to upstream protobuf.
From a usage perspective, you shouldn't notice a difference.
A big benefit to the project is that we should be able to leverage the reflection API instead of managing a static routing table in `gateway`.
