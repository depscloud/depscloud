### Upgrade to Node 16

We've upgraded the extractor process to use NodeJS 16.
This is a pretty major upgrade considering the last version we were running on was NodeJS 12.
For the most part, not much changed that impacted the `extractor` process.
There were some minor modifications, but nothing that appeared to impact the overall functionality.
